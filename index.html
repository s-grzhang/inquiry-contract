      <section class="intro">
        <p>The first time I opened <em>The Sibley Field Guide to Birds of Western North America</em>, I was stunned by the sheer number of bird species that live in King County. If we shared the same home, why hadn't I noticed them before? That moment was six years ago, and since then, I've learned that many beginner birdwatchers start with the same realization. So how can they actually see this diversity on a birdwatching trip? To increase bird sightings and have more rewarding birdwatching experiences in King County, birders should follow proven strategies involving location choice, seasonal timing, and careful observation techniques.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Go Where the Birds Are</h2>
        <p>The good news is: birds are everywhere. But some places in King County offer especially rich birdwatching experiences. According to Penelope Kipps, Communications Chair of the Eastside Audubon Society, the best local birding spots are Juanita Bay Park, Tolt MacDonald Park, and Marymoor Park. All three are fairly accessible, feature a wide variety of habitats, and offer clear, unobstructed views, making them perfect for both beginners and experienced birders.</p>
        
        <p>Juanita Bay Park is my favorite. It's a reliable, year-round spot to see birds up close. In the colder months, look for Trumpeter Swans, large white birds often gliding alongside their grayish young. In spring and summer, the Red-winged Blackbird fills the air with its melodic call, while Green-winged Teals rest with turtles, and Great Blue Herons stalk silently among the reeds.</p>
        
        <div class="image-text-container image-right">
          <div class="text-content">
            <p>At Marymoor Park, bird activity dips in fall and winter. On a recent October walk along the Audubon Bird Loop, which winds through three habitat zones, I spotted just one brown Song Sparrow - a hardy, year-round resident. But come spring, the park bursts to life. Western Meadowlarks, bright yellow with bold songs, fly low over the meadows. Male Lazuli Buntings, dazzling blue with orange breasts, perch atop conifers, each singing its own unique tune. The nest boxes by the river offer a rare chance to see swallows up close, and if you're lucky, a Purple Martin chick might peek its head out just feet away. My favorite hidden gem is the community garden, where birds forage confidently among the plots. Even that quiet October trip yielded a surprise: a Red-tailed Hawk perched on a beach umbrella.</p>

        </div>
        
        <p>Finally, Tolt MacDonald Park in Carnation may be a longer drive, but it's worth the trip, especially if you join a guided walk with Eastside Audubon. There, you might catch an Osprey diving for fish or hear the vibrant Bullock's Oriole singing from the trees in summer.</p>

        <h2>Look With Intention</h2>
        <p>The pace of the modern world can feel fast and hectic. That's why I love birdwatching. It's one of the few times I can truly slow down and observe. When you really pay attention, you uncover a world you never realized was there.</p>
        
        <blockquote>
          <p>"Take a moment to clear your mind, heighten your senses, and soak in your surroundings."</p>
          <cite>â€” Noah Strycker, Audubon Magazine</cite>
        </blockquote>
        
        <p>Investigate any shapes or silhouettes that resemble birds. This is one of the best ways to spot resting or singing species like the Red-tailed Hawk, Bald Eagle, Western Bluebird, or Song Sparrow. And watch for movement. If something shifts at the edge of your vision, turn your attention to it. It might just be a Black-capped Chickadee hopping from cone to cone on a conifer.</p>

        <h2>Time It Right</h2>
        
        <div class="image-text-container image-left">
          <div class="text-content">
            <p>According to the King County government, "Of the 164 species of birds breeding in the county, 50 are here only during the spring and summer breeding months... Approximately 50 additional species spend winter in King County but migrate north out of the county for the breeding season."</p>
            
            <p>In my experience, spring is when birds are most abundant. Food is plentiful, and many birds are actively foraging to regain energy lost during migration. Male birds sing from visible perches, and pairs can be seen gathering nesting materials in the open.</p>
            
            <p>In early to mid-summer, birds tend to be more hidden as they focus on incubating and raising their young. By late summer, bird activity increases again - fledglings begin following their parents as they prepare for fall migration.</p>

          </div>
        </div>
        
        <p>During the winter months, colder temperatures and limited food make birds less active as they work to conserve energy.</p>
        
        <p>For the most rewarding birdwatching experiences in King County, plan your trips in April, May, and August.</p>
        
        <p>Birdwatching isn't just about checking birds off a list. It's about learning to see what was always there. In King County, that means watching the seasons shift through wings and song. Whether you're standing quietly in a winter garden or catching the burst of color from a Lazuli Bunting in spring, each moment offers something extraordinary. With the right timing, a thoughtful pace, and a bit of curiosity, you'll find that the birds were never hiding - you just needed to know how to look.</p>
