# Wings Over King County: An Inquiry Project

## Project Overview
As a birdwatcher for 6 years, I have compiled the most important factors & tips for maximizing bird sightings in King County. This is especially useful for photographers trying out bird photography & beginner birdwatchers. I decided to format this article like an Audubon Magazine article. It is one of the largest birdwatching magazines in the US & my go-to birding resource.

## Research Question
**How can birdwatchers maximize sightings in King County?**

## Key Findings
My inquiry revealed three critical factors that impact the abundance of birds seen on a trip:

1. **Location Selection**: Some locations consistently provide superior birdwatching opportunities. Juanita Bay Park, Tolt MacDonald Park, and Marymoor Park offer the best combination of accessibility, habitat diversity, and unobstructed viewing.

2. **Observation Techniques**: The mindfulness aspects of birdwatching (slowing down, being present, looking with intention) significantly impact what birders are able to see.

3. **Seasonal Timing**: Bird activity and visibility follow predictable seasonal patterns. Spring (April-May) and late summer (August) offer the highest likelihood of diverse sightings, while winter and mid-summer present more challenges.

## Methodology
This inquiry combined several research approaches:

- **Field Research**: Documenting personal observations at multiple King County locations across all seasons over six years
- **Expert Interviews**: Consulting with Penelope Kipps, Communications Chair of the Eastside Audubon Society
- **Data Analysis**: Incorporating King County government data on regional bird populations and migration patterns
- **Literature Review**: Drawing on established birdwatching guides and expert perspectives

## Technical Implementation
The project is presented as an interactive web article modeled after Audubon Magazine's online format, featuring:

- Responsive design that works across devices
- Interactive audio elements for featured bird calls
- Strategic typography using Merriweather, PT Serif, and Roboto fonts
- Original photography of local birds in their natural habitats
- Side-by-side text and image layouts to enhance readability

## Reflection
Intuitively, I knew which factors lead to increased turnout. However, I never identified them with the technical precision I've discovered through this project.

This project connects to broader environmental conservation. As I connect more people to birds, I am giving birds a human voice.
