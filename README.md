# Wings Over King County: An Inquiry Project

## Project Overview
As a birdwatcher of six years, I’ve learned that the difference between an ordinary walk and an extraordinary birdwatching experience often comes down to a few key factors. This project brings together my personal observations, expert insights, and regional data to help beginner birders & bird photographers maximize their birdwatching success in King County. To make the project more engaging for my intended audience, I presented it as a digital article styled after Audubon Magazine, one of the most respected and widely read birding publications in the U.S.

## Research Question
**How can birdwatchers maximize sightings in King County?**

## Key Findings
Through this inquiry, I identified three essential components that shape the outcome of a birdwatching trip:

1. **Location Selection**: Some locations consistently provide superior birdwatching opportunities. Juanita Bay Park, Tolt MacDonald Park, and Marymoor Park offer the best combination of accessibility, habitat diversity, and unobstructed viewing.

2. **Observation Techniques**: Slowing down and being intentional while observing significantly improves what birders are able to notice. Many sightings depend on presence, patience, and tuning into subtle cues like movement.

3. **Seasonal Timing**: Bird activity follows reliable seasonal patterns. Spring (April–May) and late summer (August) are peak times for sightings. In contrast, winter and midsummer bring challenges due to migration, nesting behavior, and lower activity.

## Methodology
This project blends several forms of inquiry and research:

- **Field Research**: Personal birdwatching experiences recorded throughout the year at various sites across King County
- **Expert Interviews**: A conversation with Penelope Kipps, Communications Chair of the Eastside Audubon Society
- **Literature Review**: References to field guides & Audubon articles

## Technical Implementation
The project was developed as a responsive web article modeled after Audubon Magazine's online layout. Features include:

- Responsive design that works across devices
- Interactive audio elements for featured bird calls
- Strategic typography using Merriweather, PT Serif, and Roboto fonts to mimic National Audubon Society's website
- Color scheme utilized by the National Audubon Society
- Original photography of local birds in their natural habitats
- Side-by-side text and image layouts to enhance readability

## Reflection
Before this project, I understood intuitively what made for a great birding trip. Now, I can articulate that knowledge with evidence, language, and structure.

This work also touches on a broader mission: connecting more people to birds means creating more advocates for them. As more people learn to see birds, the birds themselves gain more visibility, both literally and metaphorically.
